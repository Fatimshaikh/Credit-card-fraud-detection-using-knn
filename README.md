Implementation of KNN for credit card fraud detection
# Credit Card Fraud Detection using KNN

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for detecting credit card fraud. The model leverages a dataset to identify fraudulent transactions and safeguard financial activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains various features related to credit card transactions, including those relevant for detecting fraudulent activities.
